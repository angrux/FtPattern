Fourier Transformation plugins

The copyright for the Ft2DS, Ft2DH, Ft3DH, iFt2DS, iFt2DH and iFt3DH plugins is an extension of the FFTW copyright and the assumed copyright for FFT_RGB routines from Alex Chirikov original source code while at Drexel University.

Modifications to FFT_RGB have been made by:
	- Alex Chirokov
	  Drexel University, 2005
	- Phil Thornton, www.mdr.co.nz
	  April 2010
	- Ron Chambers, rechmbrs@gmail.com

Release of the plugin-files as continuation of FFT_RGB routines FFT.8bf
and IFFT.8bf. The 8bf routines are plugins for Adobe Photoshop and have used
the Adobe Photoshop SDK routines**. Compilation and rules for coding were set
by Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 Community.

The original Chirokov code was available in the public domain with no specific
license attached. However, it makes use of the fftw library, which is published under the GNU license, which inter alia provides that any software using it must also be published under the GNU. This means you must publish the source, and it must be free.
